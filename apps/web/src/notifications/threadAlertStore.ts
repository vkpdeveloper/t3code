/**
 * Sidebar highlights for threads that changed while the user was away.
 *
 * Do Not Disturb can swallow the notification banner entirely, and Electron
 * exposes no way to know whether that happened. So the alert has to survive
 * being missed: when a thread finishes, fails, or needs the user without them
 * watching it, its sidebar row is marked, and the mark stays until they
 * actually open the thread. Coming back from another app, another Space, or a
 * Focus mode, the sidebar itself says what happened and where — even if
 * nothing was ever shown or heard.
 *
 * State is deliberately in-memory. A highlight answers "what happened while I
 * was away just now"; restoring week-old marks on launch would be noise.
