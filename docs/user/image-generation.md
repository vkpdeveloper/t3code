# Image generation

T3 Code can generate images through a built-in `generate_image` tool. Any signed-in provider can call it: Claude, Codex, Grok, Cursor, or OpenCode.

Turn it on in Settings → Integrations → Image generation. The default backend is Codex. You can switch it to Grok. If you ask for Grok in the prompt, that image uses Grok even when the default is Codex.

## Providers

**Codex** uses the Codex CLI already configured in T3 Code, with full access for that isolated image job. No extra API key. Images count against Codex usage.

**Grok** uses Grok Build (the same CLI as the Grok provider) with your existing `grok login` and full access for that isolated image job. You can pick Imagine 2.0, Imagine Quality, or Imagine.

Grok adds its watermark to generated images. xAI does not provide a setting to remove it.

If the selected backend is missing or signed out, the tool reports that instead of generating.

## Where files go

Generated files are stored in T3 Code's image library on the environment, under userdata `images`. They are not written into your project unless the agent copies them there. Ask it to copy a file into the repo when you want that asset committed.

Generated images also appear inline in the thread. Select the preview to open the full image.

## Quality and size

The tool defaults aspect ratio to auto. You can ask for `1k` or `2k` resolution and `low`, `medium`, or `high` quality. Both backends pass those as instructions to their built-in image tools.
