# Grok Build

For first-time setup, see [Install T3 Code](./install.md). Install Grok Build, run `grok login`, then
enable Grok in Settings. You can set a custom binary path when `grok` is not on the server's normal
command path.

## Models And Reasoning

T3 Code asks Grok Build for its current model catalog during the provider status check. Models that
advertise reasoning choices show a Reasoning selector in the model picker. T3 Code sends the model
and reasoning choice together, so changing only the reasoning level also takes effect on the next
turn.

Reasoning changes and stock Grok Build model changes work in an existing thread. After the first
turn, models that require a different strict agent harness need a new thread and are marked that way
in the picker. If another Grok Build client changes the same session, T3 Code follows the model and
reasoning level reported by Grok Build.

`Grok Build` is the compatibility fallback shown when model discovery is unavailable. Selecting it
keeps the CLI's current model instead of forcing a model named `grok-build`. Refresh provider status
after updating or signing in to Grok Build to load the current catalog and reasoning choices.

## Where Grok Skills Are Loaded

T3 Code looks for Grok skills in this order:

1. Grok home `bundled/skills`
2. `~/.agents/skills`
3. Grok home `skills` (`~/.grok/skills` by default, or `$GROK_HOME/skills`)
4. `<workspace>/.agents/skills`
5. `<workspace>/.claude/skills`
6. `<workspace>/.grok/skills`

If the same skill name exists in more than one folder, T3 Code keeps a single entry. Matching is
case-insensitive, and the later folder wins.

## Permissions

T3 Code still answers each ACP permission request according to the thread's permission setting. In
Full Access, it selects an advertised allow option automatically. In Approval Required, it shows the
request and waits for a decision.

## Usage, Titles, And Attachments

When Grok Build reports them, T3 Code can replace the default placeholder title and records
context-window usage, per-turn token totals, model usage, and trustworthy cost. Grok Build marks
incomplete or partial billing; T3 Code does not present those costs as final.

T3 Code sends image attachments to Grok Build even when the installed version reports image input
as unsupported. Grok Build saves each image in its own session directory and may inspect that copy
with `read_file`; T3 Code does not add a second machine-local path to the prompt. This works the
same way whether the turn came from web, desktop, or mobile. If Grok rejects an attachment, T3 Code
shows its error.
